        "summary_short": "Restoration can bring degraded farmland back into productivity and sequester carbon in the process.",
        "intro_short": "Around the world, many farmers are abandoning previously cultivated or grazed lands due to factors such as damaging agricultural practices, desertification, and economic challenges, which threaten food security and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The Abandoned Farmland Restoration solution aims to restore these degraded lands to a productive state, enhancing food security, livelihoods, ecosystem health, and carbon sequestration. While this model focuses on agricultural restoration, it can also be applied to reforesting lands. Given rising global food demand and the need to prevent deforestation emissions, restoring abandoned farmland is a crucial climate solution.",
        "impact": "Worldwide, millions of hectares of farmland have been abandoned due to land degradation. We project that by 2050, 189.51-296.12 million hectares could be restored and converted to regenerative annual cropping or other productive, carbon-friendly farming systems, reducing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 12.48-20.32 gigatons. This solution could provide a lifetime net profit of US$2.66-4.34 trillion with an initial investment of US$98.16-159.91 billion and lifetime net operational cost of US$3.24-5.27 trillion, while producing an additional 9.2-15 billion metric tons of food.",

        "intro_short": "Cement production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with portland cement being the most common form. The process of making portland cement releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide, primarily from the breakdown of limestone in kilns and from energy use. Project Drawdown’s Alternative Cement solution aims to reduce these emissions by making the production of clinker, a key intermediate product, more efficient and reducing its proportion in cement. This can be achieved by substituting clinker with alternative materials like fly ash, slag, and natural pozzolans, while also improving the energy efficiency of kilns. Clinker substitution could potentially avoid up to 440 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, but its success depends on standards, demand, and availability of alternatives.",
        "impact": "Cement is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and cement production is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Substituting materials such as volcanic ash, certain clays, finely ground limestone, ground bottle glass, or industrial waste products for conventional inputs can reduce the carbon footprint of cement by 7.70 to 15.56 gigatons between 2020 and 2050.",

        "intro_short": "Project Drawdown's bicycle infrastructure solution involves building bike lanes to encourage cycling and reduce reliance on motorized road vehicles, thereby lowering the need for more car infrastructure. In 2018, bicycles accounted for 2.6% of urban passenger kilometers globally, with some countries, like the Netherlands, seeing over 30% of trips made by bike. Improved bike infrastructure, particularly separate cycling lanes and traffic-calming measures, has been shown to increase cycling and walking, providing economic benefits such as reduced health, congestion, and fuel costs. Expanding bicycle infrastructure is a cost-effective way to cut emissions and promote sustainable urban transportation.",
        "impact": "We assume an increase in bicycle infrastructure will drive bicycling from under 3 percent to almost 5-6 percent of urban trips globally by 2050, displacing 2.59-2.98 trillion passenger-kilometers traveled by conventional modes of transportation and avoiding 2.73-4.63 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. By building bike infrastructure or converting lanes rather than constructing roads, municipal governments and taxpayers can realize US$2.42-3.13 trillion in construction savings and US$5.91-8.45 trillion in lifetime net operational savings.",

Biomass energy cycles carbon that is already in the atmosphere, making it a net-zero emissions source if managed sustainably. Unlike annual bioenergy crops like corn, which offer limited climate benefits, perennial grasses are more productive, require fewer resources, and are not food crops, making them an attractive option for energy production. This solution helps replace conventional power sources like coal, oil, and natural gas with a more sustainable energy system.",
        "impact": "This analysis assumes all biomass used for electricity generation is derived from perennial bioenergy feedstocks—not forests, annuals, or waste—and replaces conventional coal, oil, and natural gas. By 2050, biomass power could avoid 2.62-3.59 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions with associated marginal first costs of US$56.48-69.24 billion.

Conventional irrigation, often inefficient, consumes significant energy, but switching to sprinkler and drip systems can reduce water usage by up to 25-40% compared to traditional methods. These methods also improve yields, lower costs, reduce soil erosion, and help manage water resources. Although infrastructure costs can be high, technologies like sensors, rainwater capture, and smart irrigation scheduling offer further efficiency gains. As climate change affects rainfall patterns, efficient irrigation is a key strategy for agricultural adaptation.",
        "impact": "Use of sprinkler and drip irrigation varies widely around the world. Our analysis assumes the area under improved irrigation grows from 53.8 million hectares in 2018 to 187.71-286.47 million hectares in 2050. The highest adoption increases would occur in Asia, where 62 percent of total irrigated area is located and currently only 7 percent of that land is under micro-irrigation. This growth could avoid 1.13-2.07 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions and save 37-68 billion gallons of water with a US$534.60-938.58 billion lifetime net operational savings and a first cost of US$222.87-386.92 billion.",

Bamboo grows quickly, sequesters carbon at rates comparable to trees, and regenerates via rhizomes, eliminating the need for replanting. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse environments make it a sustainable alternative for land use. Bamboo can be harvested for over 1,500 uses, including timber, furniture, and paper, while its non-invasive nature reduces environmental concerns. Bamboo production offers a valuable approach to reforesting degraded land and mitigating climate change.",
        "impact": "The baseline for calculating impacts of increased bamboo planting is 33.52 million hectares. We assume that it will be grown on an additional 69.8-174.3 million hectares of degraded forestlands. We calculate that living biomass and long-lived bamboo products can sequester 2.03 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year, resulting in a total of 7.70-19.60 gigatons of carbon dioxide sequestered by 2050. An initial investment of US$63.30-158.98 billion and lifetime operational cost of US$1.33-3.32 trillion could yield a lifetime net profit of US$4.00-10.00 trillion.

With around 365 million metric tons of plastic produced annually, nearly all from fossil fuels, experts estimate that 90% of plastics could instead come from plants. This shift would reduce climate emissions by using carbon from the atmosphere rather than fossil fuels. However, for bioplastics to be truly sustainable, proper waste separation and processing systems are needed to ensure they are effectively managed and recycled.",
        "impact": "We estimate the total production of plastics to grow from 311 million metric tons in 2014 to at least 792 million metric tons by 2050. This is conservative, with other sources estimating more than 1 billion metric tons if trends continue. We model the growth of bioplastics to capture 89-100 percent of the market by 2050, avoiding 1.33-2.48 gigatons of emissions.

With the global average at 1.57 persons per car trip, raising occupancy can significantly cut fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Strategies to promote carpooling include high-occupancy vehicle lanes, priority parking, and shared ride services like UberPOOL. Though ride-hailing services often operate as single-user taxis, their shared versions can help increase occupancy. As policies, technologies, and demographics evolve, carpooling is expected to grow, contributing to reduced emissions in urban transportation.",

Unlike solar photovoltaic systems, CSP generates heat, allowing for energy storage without batteries, making it a renewable alternative to conventional power sources like coal and natural gas. The four main CSP technologies are parabolic trough collectors (PTC), parabolic dish collectors (PDC), heliostat towers, and linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR). While PTC is the most established, heliostat towers, which incorporate energy storage, are the most economically viable and likely to grow in use. This analysis models CSP technologies with and without storage.",

Project Drawdown’s Improved Aquaculture solution involves replacing diesel and petrol-based generators with hybrid systems incorporating renewable energy sources like solar and wind, reducing emissions from energy use. As many aquaculture operations are still being established, there is an opportunity to minimize emissions by integrating hybrid energy systems from the outset.",

Poor grazing practices have led to land degradation and loss of soil carbon, while managed grazing can enhance carbon sequestration by controlling grazing intensity and timing. Project Drawdown defines managed grazing as strategically adjusting grazing practices to improve soil and vegetation health, replacing conventional grazing on grasslands. This approach can sequester 0.5 to 3 metric tons of carbon per acre, with methane and nitrous oxide emissions from ruminants offset by carbon sequestration until soil saturation is reached.",
        "impact": "Managed grazing can sequester 13.72-20.92 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050. However, this does not reduce the 10 gigatons of methane that are emitted on that grazing land today.

        "intro_short": "Distributed solar photovoltaics (PV), typically installed on rooftops with capacities under 1 megawatt, replace traditional electricity sources like coal, oil, and natural gas power plants. Solar cells convert sunlight into electricity and come in three generations: first-generation silicon-based cells, second-generation thin-film cells, and advanced third-generation cells currently in development. While earlier forecasts estimated that PV would contribute less than 10% of electricity by 2050, recent trends in adoption, efficiency improvements, and declining costs suggest that solar PV could supply nearly 60% of global electricity by 2050.",
        "impact": "We assume that distributed solar photovoltaics can grow from 180 terawatt-hours of electricity generation to 6,010.21-9,786.80 terawatt-hours by 2050. This large range is due to the many possibilities for future renewable technologies and the extent of electrification. That growth can avoid 26.65-64.86 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions. With implementation costs declining by the day, increased adoption of distributed solar photovoltaics could save US$7.61-13.14 trillion in operation, maintenance, and fuel costs over fossil fuel-based electricity generation.",

This system mimics natural forests and offers substantial carbon sequestration while producing food. It also provides ecosystem services such as habitat, erosion control, and water quality. Replacing grazing on nondegraded tropical humid grassland, it has modest adoption potential but a high mitigation impact, combining the benefits of afforestation with food production. Protecting and expanding multistrata agroforestry in tropical humid climates should be a top priority for land-based climate solutions.",

Recycling paper involves processes like sorting, shredding, and de-inking, whereas conventional paper production requires harvesting, debarking, and pulping. Recycling uses less energy and emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to traditional methods. Paper can be recycled about five to seven times before the fibers degrade. Increasing paper recycling not only reduces emissions but also conserves forests and water. With global paper use rising, particularly for packaging, improving recovery rates—currently at around 50% worldwide, with some areas achieving 75%—can further lower emissions. Project Drawdown’s Recycled Paper solution focuses on enhancing the recovery and reprocessing of used paper to replace virgin paper feedstocks.",
        "impact": "Over 30 years, recycled paper can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.28-2.90 gigatons. Two key assumptions inform this conclusion: 1) recycled paper produces about 25 percent fewer total emissions than conventional paper, and 2) the percentage of paper made from recycled paper rises from 55 percent to 69-74 percent. Although recycled paper content uses more electricity, the emissions related to harvesting and processing—and the total emissions from pulping and manufacturing—are higher for paper using virgin wood feedstock.

Despite making up just over 4% of vehicles in the US and 9% of total mileage, trucks consume over 25% of fuel, with road freight responsible for about 6% of global emissions. To counteract rising emissions, available efficiency measures include low-rolling-resistance tires, more efficient engines, idling reduction devices, aerodynamic improvements, and predictive cruise control. Implementing these technologies broadly could offer substantial emissions and financial benefits compared to continuing with conventional trucks.",
        "impact": "If adoption of fuel-saving technologies grows from 1.6 percent to 8.6-9.0 percent of trucks by 2050, this solution can deliver 9.15-10.77 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions reductions.

The main geothermal technologies include dry steam, flash steam (the most common), and binary cycle plants (which can utilize lower temperature reservoirs but are costlier). Geothermal power is reliable and efficient, operating continuously regardless of weather conditions, though drilling costs can be high. Enhanced or engineered systems, such as those exploiting “hot rock,” have the potential to significantly increase geothermal energy contributions, but these systems are still in early stages of development.",

While they enhance crop growth, unused nitrogen harms soil, pollutes waterways, and contributes to climate change. To mitigate these effects, farmers should apply fertilizers judiciously based on plant needs, timing, and placement. Project Drawdown defines optimal fertilizer application as using the right source, rate, time, and placement. This approach is crucial for both high-consumption countries with low nitrogen efficiency and those needing increased nutrient inputs. Education, assistance, incentives, and regulation can accelerate adoption, but the ultimate solution lies in land management practices that minimize or eliminate the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.",
        "impact": "Reducing fertilizer overuse on 373.98-750.52 million hectares of farmland by 2050—up from an estimated 139 million hectares currently—could avoid nitrous oxide emissions equal to 2.77-11.48 gigatons of carbon dioxide.

Currently, only about 6% of this carbon-rich area is protected through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) or highly protected, no-take MPAs. Much of this vulnerable carbon remains unprotected within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), which face high levels of disruption from activities like bottom trawling.
